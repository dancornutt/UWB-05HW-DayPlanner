# Personal Day Planner

This project is centered on creating a site to help users organize and schedule their day. The basis was utilizing Bootsrap's grid system and components. Majority of the styling was provided in a boilerplate css file.

## Getting Started

Luckily this is a static site so there isn't much set-up to do. knowledge of javascript would be helpful if you would like to add more functionality to the planner.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have a good text editor or IDE for making edits to the code. For this project VS Code was used and was very useful.
Below are the tools used for this site:
    * Text Editor
    * Git
    * Github account
    * Browser (Chrome was used for development)

### Installing

These are the installation steps to get the site up and running:

    * Log into Github
    * Fork this repo
    * Clone your Forked repo on your local machine
    * Navigate to the index.html file and open it in your favorite browser

## Running the tests

No tests were constructed, this is an area of opportunity for any one interested in collaborating.
